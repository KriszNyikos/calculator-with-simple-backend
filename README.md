# calculator-with-simple-backend

## Features

### - Frontend 
- [ ] A calculator app should be created in React framework  
- [ ] The app have to use the base operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  
- [ ] The application should support decimal point  
- [ ] The app should have a clear button  
- [ ] The app should have memory read and write button  
- [ ] The app should use backend API for memory operations

### - Backend
- [ ] Backend should use Node.js and Express
- [ ] Backend should have two endpoints
    - One for storing a number (PUT)
    - One for returning the stored number (GET)
- [ ] Backend should store a number in a file (I choosed JSON)

Exra question: 
How could I change the code for a scalable backend solution that serves 1000 users with multiple servers?
